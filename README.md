# Exploring terrorism in Peru: A spatial approach

This repository contains the code and files to replicate the master's thesis "Exploring terrorism in Peru: A spatial approach", by G. Carolina Cornejo Castellano as part of the Master in Computational Social Sciences (MUCSS), 2022- 2023.

## Replication

Clone the repository in your local drive. Then, set it as the workspace. As part of the code, the `.zip` files that contain the datasets and shapefiles will be extracted. The code itself will install the necessary packages that are not already installed.

The sources of the datasets and shapefiles are stated in the thesis.
