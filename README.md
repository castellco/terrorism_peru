# Exploring terrorism in Peru: A spatial approach

This repository contains the Rmd file, datasets and shapefiles used in the master's thesis "Exploring terrorism in Peru: A spatial approach", by G. Carolina Cornejo Castellano as part of the Master in Computational Social Sciences (MUCSS), 2022- 2023, at the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid.
## Usage
Clone the repository in your local drive. Then, set it as the workspace. As part of the Rmd code, the `.zip` files that contain the datasets and shapefiles will be extracted. Besides, the code itself will install the necessary packages that are not already installed.

## Files
The `/data/data.zip` folder contains the following files:
- `gtd_1970_2020.csv`, part of the Global Terrorism Database (University of Maryland, n.d.) with information on terrorist attacks around the world up to the year 2020.
- `gtd_ene_jun_2021.csv`, part of the Global Terrorism Database (University of Maryland, n.d.) with information on terrorist attacks around the world from 2020 to mid-2021.
- `prio.csv`, dataset with geodemographic variables specified at the 0.5 x 05 degree grid level (PRIO-GRID, n.d.)
- `xSub_GED_PER_priogrid_year.csv`, dataset with geodemographic variables compatibles with PRIO-GRID cells (University of Michigan, n.d.)

The `shapefiles/` folder contains subfolders with the shapefiles of grids cells worldwide and the external boundaries of Peru.

The `figs/` folder contains self-made figures that served to complement the thesis in .pdf.
